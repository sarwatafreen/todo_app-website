# Data Model: Phase I Todo Console Application

## Task Entity

**Description**: Represents a single todo task in the system

**Fields**:
- `id` (integer): Unique sequential identifier assigned when task is created
  - Auto-generated by TaskManager
  - Starts from 1 and increments for each new task
  - Required field, cannot be null
- `description` (string): Text content describing what needs to be done
  - User-provided during task creation/update
  - Required field, cannot be empty
  - Maximum length: No enforced limit (limited by system memory)
- `completed` (boolean): Status indicating if the task is complete
  - Default value: False (incomplete) when task is created
  - Can be toggled between complete/incomplete states
  - Required field, cannot be null

**Validation Rules**:
- Task ID must be a positive integer
- Task description must not be empty or contain only whitespace
- Task description must be a string
- Completed status must be a boolean value

**State Transitions**:
- New Task: `completed = False` (default)
- Mark Complete: `completed = False` → `completed = True`
- Mark Incomplete: `completed = True` → `completed = False`

**Relationships**:
- TaskManager contains multiple Task entities (1-to-many relationship)

## TaskManager Entity

**Description**: Manages the collection of Task entities in memory

**Fields**:
- `tasks` (list): In-memory storage containing all Task objects
  - Maintains order of task creation
  - Provides O(n) lookup by ID
- `next_id` (integer): Next ID to assign to a new task
  - Starts at 1
  - Automatically incremented when a new task is added

**Operations**:
- `add_task(description)`: Creates new Task with next available ID and adds to tasks list
- `get_task_by_id(task_id)`: Returns Task object with matching ID or None if not found
- `get_all_tasks()`: Returns list of all Task objects
- `update_task(task_id, new_description)`: Updates description of existing Task
- `delete_task(task_id)`: Removes Task from tasks list
- `mark_task_complete(task_id)`: Sets completed status to True
- `mark_task_incomplete(task_id)`: Sets completed status to False

**Validation Rules**:
- Task IDs must exist in the tasks list before performing operations
- Task descriptions cannot be empty during creation or updates
- Operations must fail gracefully if task ID doesn't exist
