# Todo Full-Stack Web Application - Phase II Completion Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of the Phase II specification development for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application, following the Hackathon Constitution's requirements for spec-driven development.

## Constitutional Compliance
✅ **Spec-Driven Development Only**: All changes made exclusively through specification files under `/specs`
✅ **No Manual Code Edits**: Only specification files were created/modified
✅ **Technology Stack Compliance**: All mandatory technologies included (Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, uv)
✅ **Architectural Rules**: Repository pattern, service layer, frontend/backend separation implemented in specs
✅ **Non-Negotiables**: No hard-coded data, repository-only DB access, specification-driven approach enforced

## Specification Package Complete
The following specification files have been created and validated:

### Core Specifications
- `spec.md` - Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- `plan.md` - Detailed architectural plan with constitutional compliance section
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks with acceptance criteria
- `data-model.md` - Detailed data model specification

### Supporting Documents
- `quickstart.md` - Development environment setup guide
- `research.md` - Technology research and considerations
- `api-contract.md` - Detailed API contract in contracts/ directory
- `implementation-checklist.md` - Validation checklist in checklists/ directory

### Governance
- `README.md` - Updated to reflect Phase I to Phase II transition
- `history/prompts/spec/` - PHR documents for audit trail
- `history/adr/0001-fullstack-web-app-architecture.md` - Architectural Decision Record

## Implementation Readiness
The specification package is complete and ready for Claude Code implementation. All constitutional requirements have been explicitly documented in the specifications to ensure proper implementation adherence.

## Next Steps
1. Claude Code will implement the application based on these specifications
2. Implementation must follow all architectural patterns specified
3. All constitutional compliance requirements must be validated during implementation
4. No manual code edits are permitted - all changes must be spec-driven
